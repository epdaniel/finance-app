A simple finance app to keep track of your funds.

Deployed in herokuapp: https://dans-finance.herokuapp.com/

TODO:
 - Lift state of User Logged-in to app
 - UserProfile is probably useless, move info to app / googlebtn
 - make sure date flows between log in button (state) and list of entries
 - stylize the entry 
 - filter entries?
